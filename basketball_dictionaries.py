# Basketball Dictionaries Assignment:

# Paul is a fantasy basketball league manager, but also a programmer! He is trying to organize fantasy teams of players (that can be from any of the real teams) for his league website. There is already a web service that collects the line-up data from friends in batches.

# So far, he has been able to get a single list of dictionaries at a time from the API, and would like to put each team into a list of Player object instances, so that he can use methods related to players.

# The lists look something like this:

players = [
    {
    	"name": "Kevin Durant", 
    	"age":34, 
    	"position": "small forward", 
    	"team": "Brooklyn Nets"
    },
    {
    	"name": "Jason Tatum", 
    	"age":24, 
    	"position": "small forward", 
    	"team": "Boston Celtics"
    },
    {
    	"name": "Kyrie Irving", 
    	"age":32, "position": "Point Guard", 
    	"team": "Brooklyn Nets"
    },
    {
    	"name": "Damian Lillard", 
    	"age":33, "position": "Point Guard", 
    	"team": "Portland Trailblazers"
    },
    {
    	"name": "Joel Embiid", 
    	"age":32, "position": "Power Foward", 
    	"team": "Philidelphia 76ers"
    },
    {
    	"name": "", 
    	"age":16, 
    	"position": "P", 
    	"team": "en"
    }
]

# Assignment Tasks:

# Challenge 1: Update the Constructor
# His class constructor so far looks like this:

# class Player:
#     def __init__(self, name, age, position, team):
#         self.name = name
#         self.age = age
#         self.position = position
#         self.team = team

# Update the constructor to accept a dictionary with a single player's information instead of individual arguments for the attributes.

class Player:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.name = data['name']
        self.age = data['age']
        self.position = data['position']
        self.team = data['team']

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Player: {self.name} is {self.age} years old, is a {self.position} for the {self.team}."

# Challenge 2: Create instances using individual player dictionaries.
# Given these variables, create Player instances for each of the following dictionaries. Be sure to instantiate these outside the class definition, in the outer scope.

kevin = {
    	"name": "Kevin Durant", 
    	"age":34, 
    	"position": "small forward", 
    	"team": "Brooklyn Nets"
}
jason = {
    	"name": "Jason Tatum", 
    	"age":24, 
    	"position": "small forward", 
    	"team": "Boston Celtics"
}
kyrie = {
    	"name": "Kyrie Irving", 
    	"age":32, "position": "Point Guard", 
    	"team": "Brooklyn Nets"
}
    
# # Create your Player instances here!
player_jason = Player(jason)
player_kevin = Player(kevin)
player_kyrie = Player(kyrie)
print(player_jason)
print(player_kevin)
print(player_kyrie)



# Challenge 3:
# Finally, given the example list of players at the top of this module (the one with many players) write a for loop that will populate an empty list with Player objects from the original list of dictionaries.
